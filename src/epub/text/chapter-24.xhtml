			<p>She had scarcely set down my heavy box, which she seemed to have considerable difficulty in raising on the table, when the door of the room in which I had seen the coffin, opened, and a sinister and unexpected apparition entered.</p>
			<p>It was the Count de <abbr>St.</abbr> Alyre, who had been, as I have told you, reported to me to be, for some considerable time, on his way to Père la Chaise. He stood before me for a moment, with the frame of the doorway and a background of darkness enclosing him, like a portrait. His slight, mean figure was draped in the deepest mourning. He had a pair of black gloves in his hand, and his hat with crape round it.</p>
			<p>When he was not speaking his face showed signs of agitation; his mouth was puckering and working. He looked damnably wicked and frightened.</p>
			<p>“Well, my dear Eugenie? Well, child⁠—eh? Well, it all goes admirably?”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” she answered, in a low, hard tone. “But you and Planard should not have left that door open.”</p>
			<p>This she said sternly. “He went in there and looked about wherever he liked; it was fortunate he did not move aside the lid of the coffin.”</p>
			<p>“Planard should have seen to that,” said the Count, sharply. “<i xml:lang="fr">Ma foi!</i> I can’t be everywhere!” He advanced half-a-dozen short quick steps into the room toward me, and placed his glasses to his eyes.</p>
			<p>“Monsieur Beckett,” he cried sharply, two or three times, “Hi! don’t you know me?”</p>
			<p>He approached and peered more closely in my face; raised my hand and shook it, calling me again, then let it drop, and said⁠—“It has set in admirably, my pretty mignonne. When did it commence?”</p>
			<p>The Countess came and stood beside him, and looked at me steadily for some seconds.</p>
			<p>You can’t conceive the effect of the silent gaze of those two pairs of evil eyes.</p>
			<p>The lady glanced to where, I recollected, the mantelpiece stood, and upon it a clock, the regular click of which I sharply heard.</p>
			<p>“Four⁠—five⁠—six minutes and a half,” she said slowly, in a cold hard way.</p>
			<p>“Brava! Bravissima! my beautiful queen! my little Venus! my Joan of Arc! my heroine! my paragon of women!”</p>
			<p>He was gloating on me with an odious curiosity, smiling, as he groped backward with his thin brown fingers to find the lady’s hand; but she, not (I dare say) caring for his caresses, drew back a little.</p>
			<p>“Come, <i xml:lang="fr">ma chère</i>, let us count these things. What is it? Pocketbook? Or⁠—or⁠—<em>what</em>?”</p>
			<p>“It is <em>that</em>!” said the lady, pointing with a look of disgust to the box, which lay in its leather case on the table.</p>
			<p>“Oh! Let us see⁠—let us count⁠—let us see,” he said, as he was unbuckling the straps with his tremulous fingers. “We must count them⁠—we must see to it. I have pencil and pocketbook⁠—but⁠—where’s the key? See this cursed lock! My ⸻! What is it? Where’s the key?”</p>
			<p>He was standing before the Countess, shuffling his feet, with his hands extended and all his fingers quivering.</p>
			<p>“I have not got it; how could I? It is in his pocket, of course,” said the lady.</p>
			<p>In another instant the fingers of the old miscreant were in my pockets: he plucked out everything they contained, and some keys among the rest.</p>
			<p>I lay in precisely the state in which I had been during my drive with the Marquis to <span epub:type="z3998:place">Paris</span>. This wretch I knew was about to rob me. The whole drama, and the Countess’s role in it, I could not yet comprehend. I could not be sure⁠—so much more presence of mind and histrionic resource have women than fall to the lot of our clumsy sex⁠—whether the return of the Count was not, in truth, a surprise to her; and this scrutiny of the contents of my strong box, an extempore undertaking of the Count’s. But it was clearing more and more every moment: and I was destined, very soon, to comprehend minutely my appalling situation.</p>
			<p>I had not the power of turning my eyes this way or that, the smallest fraction of a hair’s breadth. But let anyone, placed as I was at the end of a room, ascertain for himself by experiment how wide is the field of sight, without the slightest alteration in the line of vision, he will find that it takes in the entire breadth of a large room, and that up to a very short distance before him; and imperfectly, by a refraction, I believe, in the eye itself, to a point very near indeed. Next to nothing that passed in the room, therefore, was hidden from me.</p>
			<p>The old man had, by this time, found the key. The leather case was open. The box cramped round with iron was next unlocked. He turned out its contents upon the table.</p>
			<p>“Rouleaux of a hundred Napoleons each. One, two, three. Yes, quick. Write down a thousand Napoleons. One, two; yes, right. Another thousand, <em>write</em>!” And so, on and on till the gold was rapidly counted. Then came the notes.</p>
			<p>“Ten thousand francs. <em>Write.</em> Ten thousand francs again: is it written? Another ten thousand francs: is it down? Smaller notes would have been better. They should have been smaller. These are horribly embarrassing. Bolt that door again; Planard would become unreasonable if he knew the amount. Why did you not tell him to get it in smaller notes? No matter now⁠—go on⁠—it can’t be helped⁠—<em>write</em>⁠—another ten thousand francs⁠—another⁠—another.” And so on, till my treasure was counted out, before my face, while I saw and heard all that passed with the sharpest distinctness, and my mental perceptions were horribly vivid. But in all other respects I was dead.</p>
			<p>He had replaced in the box every note and rouleau as he counted it, and now having ascertained the sum total, he locked it, replaced it, very methodically, in its cover, opened a buffet in the wainscoting, and, having placed the Countess’ jewel-case and my strong box in it, he locked it; and immediately on completing these arrangements he began to complain, with fresh acrimony and maledictions of Planard’s delay.</p>
			<p>He unbolted the door, looked in the dark room beyond, and listened. He closed the door again, and returned. The old man was in a fever of suspense.</p>
			<p>“I have kept ten thousand francs for Planard,” said the Count, touching his waistcoat pocket.</p>
			<p>“Will that satisfy him?” asked the lady.</p>
			<p>“Why⁠—curse him!” screamed the Count. “Has he no conscience! I’ll swear to him it’s half the entire thing.”</p>
			<p>He and the lady again came and looked at me anxiously for awhile, in silence; and then the old Count began to grumble again about Planard, and to compare his watch with the clock. The lady seemed less impatient; she sat no longer looking at me, but across the room, so that her profile was toward me⁠—and strangely changed, dark and witch-like it looked. My last hope died as I beheld that jaded face from which the mask had dropped. I was certain that they intended to crown their robbery by murder. Why did they not despatch me at once? What object could there be in postponing the catastrophe which would expedite their own safety. I cannot recall, even to myself, adequately the horrors unutterable that I underwent. You must suppose a real nightmare⁠—I mean a nightmare in which the objects and the danger are real, and the spell of corporal death appears to be protractable at the pleasure of the persons who preside at your unearthly torments. I could have no doubt as to the cause of the state in which I was.</p>
			<p>In this agony, to which I could not give the slightest expression, I saw the door of the room where the coffin had been, open slowly, and the Marquis d’Harmonville entered the room.</p>
